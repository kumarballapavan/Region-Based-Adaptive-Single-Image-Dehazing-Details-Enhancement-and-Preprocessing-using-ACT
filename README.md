# Region based Adaptive single image dehazing

This is the repository for the paper Kumar, Balla Pavan, Arvind Kumar, and Rajoo Pandey. "Region-based adaptive single image dehazing, detail enhancement and pre-processing using auto-colour transfer method." Signal Processing: Image Communication 100 (2022): 116532.

The details of the method is described in the paper.


### Requirements
- MATLAB (tested on 2018 or above). It may work for old versions also.

### Demo

Run 'demo.m' script to get sample results. There are several sample haze images in 'DB Universal' folder (from RESIDE, Densehaze, IHaze, O-haze and NH-Haze databases). Per one hazy image, the pre-processed map, image categorization, dehazed output mapping and final output image  will be plotted.
